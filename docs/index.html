      <p>NXBoot enables starting custom boot code on the Nintendo Switch through the Fusée Gelée hardware exploit.</p>
      <p>A jailbreak is required. For jailbreaking info visit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak">/r/jailbreak</a>. Please keep in mind that jailbreaking is detrimental to your phone's security. You should never jailbreak a phone that stores sensitive data. The minimum supported iOS version is iOS 9.0.</p>

          (v0.3.0)<br/>
        <small>TrollStore or AppSync Unified are <u>required</u>. Attempting to otherwise sideload NXBoot will render it non-functional. Please read the FAQ for more information.</small>

        <small>The command-line version of NXBoot works on iOS 9.0+ and macOS 10.11+. It is also available at /usr/bin/nxboot when the Cydia package is installed. Run ./nxboot -h for usage info.</small>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>
        <b>I don't have a jailbreak. Can this work as self-signed IPA too?</b><br/>
        Only if you have a device that is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore">TrollStore</a>. Otherwise it is impossible, because a side-loaded IPA cannot get any sandbox exceptions, which NXBoot requires for raw USB device access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the iOS hardware requirements?</b><br/>
        An OTG adapter <u>on the Lightning end of the connection</u> is required. Setup example: An iPhone 6 with NXBoot, connected to an Apple Lightning USB 2 Camera Adapter, where a standard USB 3 Type A to Type C cable connects the adapter with the Nintendo Switch:<br/>
        <a href="nxboot_setup_photo.jpg"><img src="nxboot_setup_photo.jpg" alt="NXBoot Setup Photo" style="height: 100px; border: 2px solid #333; margin-top: 8px;"/></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Does it work without a Lightning OTG adapter?</b><br/>
        Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you make it work without an Lightning OTG adapter?</b><br/>
        Maybe, probably not. I'd be interested in technical details about the Lightning Camera adapter's internals and how iOS deals with USB host and device mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Will cheap, non-Apple OTG adapters work?</b><br/>
        Maybe. I've received reports from some people who had success with cheap $5 Lightning OTG adapters, but others did not get their third-party adapter to work at all or had USB communication errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why use your app at all if it requires a $30 adapter?</b><br/>
        Because you've already got that adapter, or find it convenient, or found a cheap third-party adapter that works for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>iOS software requirements?</b><br/>
        NXBoot was tested and found compatible with all jailbreaks for iOS 10 and later, up to iOS 17. It may break if Apple changes some of its private APIs or sandbox details in future iOS versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nintendo Switch requirements?</b><br/>
        Any first generation Nintendo Switch with any firmware will work. There are reports about patched Nintendo Switch hardware on which the exploit no longer runs, but any switch purchased before 2018-07 should be safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Is this app free?</b><br/>
        Yes and there are no ads. It was created as a fun experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Is it open-source / free software?</b><br/>
        Yes! The source code was released 2019-09-02 under the GPLv3. It is available at <a href="https://github.com/mologie/nxboot">GitHub</a>. Pull requests are welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is the difference between your command-line tool and others?</b><br/>
        The functionality is most likely equivalent, but nxboot has zero dependencies (it works directly with IOKit) and can any payload out of the box.
